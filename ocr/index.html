                I addressed the business goal of boosting user engagement
                through showing more reviews from verified users and
                higher-quality reviews. To translate the business needs into a
                tangible design solution, I extensively explored various
                technology and design options.
                <br />
                As a result, the implemented design solution successfully
                achieved a significant 21% increase in screen views, and the
                number of screen views and number of users increased by 14% in
                just one week.

                      Working at a big tech company, there are occasions where
                      additional features need to be added within tight
                      deadlines. From this experience, I learned to facilitate
                      efficient decision-making in limited timeframes.
                      Understanding stakeholders’ needs and users’ pain points
                      can be invaluable in driving the design process.
